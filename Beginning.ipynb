    "<p>Ancient civilizations really only cared about natural numbers like 1, 2, and 3. This is because the only things humans needed to do back then was add and subtract stuff. Then the Egyptians expanded on this idea to facilitate monetary transactions by inventing fractions. The next big innovation in the number line was 0 and negative numbers with the invention of debt.\n",

    "Around five centuries ago, a mathematician by the name of Del Ferro was playing around with the quadratic formula trying to find an equation to cubic functions. At that time, mathematicians would hold duels, and they made money by winning these math duels. Del Ferro successfully found an equation for cubic functions, and kept this equation secret in order to win. The only problem was that his equation did not work for certain numbers due to square roots of negatives. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Del Ferro kept his formula secret to his dying day, on which he told he passed his knowledge to his only student Foir. Foir, with his new formula got cocky and challenged Fontana Tartaglia, another respected mathematician to a duel believing he would win. Tartaglia already claimed he could solve cubic functions, but he was lying. Before the match however, he actually figured it out and beat Foir. \n",

    "Tartaglia ended up sharing his and Foir's secret formula for cubics under pressure from Cardan, who discovered Del Ferro's original work and decided it was not a big deal for him to publish Del Ferro's work to the public. It was not until another generation of mathematicians that Bombelli, Cardan's student made significant strides with the cubic function. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Bombelli is credited with being one of the first mathematicians to allow square roots of negatives to exist in his equation, or the imaginary number. Additionally this allowed him to find the solution to Cardan's problem. Bombelli never gave his work any credit however, and regarded it as sophistry. \n",

    "<p>Let's start by just graphing nothing. In order to graph nothing, we have to decide what nothing means to us. To me, nothing is the absence of matter. In our universe, the framework for this would be our space-time framework, or the 4d fiber we experience as reality. A four dimensional framework roughly means that we need three directions and a unit of time to describe something. At each moment, each of us has a three-dimensional direction and a unit of time in the space-time fiber. Below I wrote a program to display an animation of 3 space and time. This graph has to be an animation for it to make sense to human beings, but we could also create a graph in 3d with color as the fourth dimension.</p> "
